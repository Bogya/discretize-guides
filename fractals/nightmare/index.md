## Assault Knights
Stack <Boon name="might"/> before jumping down. Kill the three *Assault Knights* (Red, Blue and Green), each of them has the same set of abilities: a PBAoE knockdown and an AoE pull which covers the entire room except the knight's position. Break their bar, kill them, MAMA will arise when the three knights are dead, do <Command name="gg"/> to reset fight.

## MAMA test request
Stack <Boon name="might"/> before jumping down.
MAMA will arise, her first atack is a spin, which a Mesmer blocks by sharing <Boon name="aegis"/>. Learn to dodge the spinning attacks after the first and turn away from your party members shortly before the *Vomit Toxin* hits (orange cone), otherwise you will 'infect' party members in front of you with it.    
Every 25%, MAMA becomes invulnerable and an *Assault Knight* (similar to the knights before) will spawn. Quickly break their breakbar then kill them as MAMA will continue it's attacks.    
When MAMA reaches 33%, it conjures a large *Nightmare Miasma* field around it which deals enormous damage. It will also become mobile, start jumping to players, offloading shockwaves and hitting with <Control name="stun"/> cone attacks.    
At the last 25% of the boss, kill the knight as fast as possible, since MAMA can wipe your party easily with the combined attacks of the knight.
Fast crowd control and animation knowledge are the keys to this fight, especially at around 25%.

<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="chronomancer">Due to the <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> mistlock instability, run <Skill id="10267"/> for the entire fractal. Or you can use a Spellbraker to remove boons.<br/>Also run <Skill id="29519"/> for the stronger defiance bars. Use it immediately on the last assault knight spawning at 25% of MAMA's health.<br/>Time your distortions for key attacks like MAMA's spinning and triple shockwave (&lt;33%), but remember the internal 5s cooldown and 300 yard range of group distortion on <Trait id="1852"/>.<br/>Take <Skill id="21750"/> to immediately recharge your phantasms for the adds, especially for <Skill id="10267"/> to immediately remove the boons.</Tip> 
    <Tip specialization="warrior">For the entire fractal, remember to place your banners at the boss before doing <Command name="gg"/> as they will continue to exist through death. This way, you can keep them up permanently even without <Effect name="alacrity"/>.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="druid">If you have problems with incoming damage, swap <Skill id="12497"/> with <Skill id="12495"/> to grant <Boon name="protection"/> to the party.<br/><Skill id="31639"/> from your Electric Wyvern pet deals enormous defiance bar damage to the bosses, they all have a large hitbox.</Tip>

## First set of altars
You need to cap two altars to continue. Pull the two groups of Krait back to the passage and kill all enemies there. Start capping the altars as soon as possible, but keep in mind that standing inside puts <Effect name="agony"/> on yourself. Only enemy Krait counteract the capping here, you can ignore the Hallucinations.    
Learn the *Red Orb* patterns as they can quickly kill you, *Blue Orbs* will heal you for a large amount of health (even with Agony).    
On a side note, more players do not cap an altar faster. More than one person standing inside is redundant.

## Second set of altars
Again, pull all enemies to the center (Mesmer focus <Skill id="10186"/> pulls all) and kill them there. The mobs at the left altar (West on minimap) can be aggroed with a simple projectile, the mobs on the right side (East on minimap) need to be pulled with Warrior Longbow 3 <Skill id="14381"/> or Weaver autoattack <Skill id="5491"/> or just by teleporting up and jumping down.    
Both side altars can easily be capped by a single person (usually Mesmer or Warrior) after another player has pulled down the mobs.    
Contrary to the first set of altars, respawning *Veteran Hallucinations* counteract capping here. Use pulls to grab them out of the central altar and always have a positive amount of players inside.    
After you capped all three altars use <Command name="gg"/> if somebody in the party needs it, then you can continue up to the 2nd boss. Before the ramp up, a group of Krait will attack you - simply keep walking to skip them. Use dodges, evades or invulnerables to get through the cascading orbs and disable them by activating the orb at the top of the ramp. Please note that advanced groups do not <Command name="gg"/> before Siax, instead stack <Boon name="might"/> before they get in combat, then proceed into the fight, saving some time.

<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="chronomancer">Use <Skill id="10363"/> to pull mobs together.<br/>You can <Skill id="10200"/> and aggro the Krait at the eastern altar during <Skill id="29830"/> if you're fast. Afterwards teleport up to one of the altars as soon as someone pulled the mobs down.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="weaver"><Skill id="5738"/> is very strong against the groups of Krait.<br/>Use <Skill id="5536"/> to teleport up to the altars.</Tip>

## Siax the Corrupted
After the interaction with the red orb in the center of the area. Quickly move back to the *Mistlock Singularity* to avoid aggro from the spawning enemies and stack <Boon name="might"/>.

During the fight, break his defiance bar (2000 CC damage) as fast as possible to interrupt his *Caustic Explosion* skill. Siax will wipe your party if you fail to interrupt it with enough crowd control. Pay attention to his bouncing orb barrages, the *Vomit Toxin* and the exploding *Volatile Hallucinations* (at &lt;75%). Do not stand in the PBAoE when the inner circle reaches the outer to avoid spawning a *Nightmare Hallucination*.

When Siax reaches 66%, four *Echoes of the Unclean* will spawn in the North, East, South and West which need to be killed quickly to interrupt his *Caustic Explosions*. The same occurs at 33%, though the adds will have their spawning positions shifted clockwise.

Assign players to each add before the fight by setting waypoints. The Mesmer and Druid will usually focus on one mob together due to their lower DPS.

<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="chronomancer">Share <Skill id="10192"/> with your party when the *Nightmare Hallucination* PBAoE goes off or too many *Volatile Hallucinations* explode on the party.<br/>With <Skill id="21750"/> you can recast your phantasms on the *Echo of the Unclean* to deal more damage.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="druid">If you have problems with the incoming damage, swap <Skill id="12497"/> with <Skill id="12495"/> to grant <Boon name="protection"/> to the party.<br/>If you have trouble with the orbs leaving toxic trails, position yourself away from the boss to keep them from the melee area as he throws them on the furthest player (this is especially useful if you do not have enough damage).</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="weaver">On the East and South *Echoes of the Unclean*, you can use <Skill id="5697"/> from <Skill id="5516"/> against the wall to deal enormous damage.</Tip>

## Ensolyss of the Endless Torment
Walk through the teleporter and trigger Ensolyss once after defeating Siax to gain the new checkpoint and use <Command name="gg"/> to reset all cooldowns. Stack <Boon name="might"/> before you activate the fight. Don't stand in the center area of the platform on activation or you will get a <Control name="knockback"/>.

Nearly all of Ensolyss' attacks do a <Control name="knockback"/> or <Control name="pull"/>, learn to dodge or walk out of every attack. The most dangerous one is his shockwave-shatter combo, he smashes down a stunning yellow shockwave (like MAMA &lt;33%), spawns hallucinations on each players position and shatters them after two seconds.    
Again, the key to this fight is fast crowd control. Break his defiance bar quickly to interrupt his high damage attacks. Always stack around the center area and do not try to follow him to the edge as he will simply teleport back most of the time.

### Orb phases *66%, 33%*
At 66% and 33%, Ensolyss will teleport to the middle and gain <Effect name="invulnerability"/>. Your party will need to split up and cap five altars, similar to the ones before.    
*Red Orbs* and stunning shockwaves emerge from the middle, learn the patterns to avoid any damage. Try to catch the *Blue Orbs* as they heal you for a significant amount. Note that *Blue Orbs* only spawn at 66% if all altars are capped as fast as possible.

After the orb phases, the defiance bar needs to be broken immediately to prevent Ensolyss from knocking everyone off the platform. His defiance bar will recover shortly after being broken for the first time, break it a second time (especially at 33%) to further prevent his attacks and deal more damage thanks to <Item id="24868"/> and <Trait id="1502"/>.

Below 66%, Ensolyss gains a new ability where he smashes two quarters of the platform subsequently and knocks everyone inside the **orange** areas off the platform, similar to the skill immediately after the orb phases. It it safe to stand inside the**purple** areas.

Below 33%, he may summon a special shockwave which travels inwards to him (contrary to the ones before) and deal enormous damage to everyone near him. With enough crowd control and DPS this should never occur.

### Final phase *<15%*
When Ensolyss reaches 15% health, he will stop using his usual attacks, but only a small bubble in the middle will protect you from his deathly rain. Krait will charge through the middle (indicated by large arrows on the ground) and make positioning harder, kill Ensolyss quickly to finish the fractal. If needed, use <Command name="gg"/> to reset cooldowns after the fractal finished.

<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="chronomancer">If you party damage is high enough, swap the Domination traitline for Illusions to reduce the cooldown for <Trait id="731"/> you are able to use <Skill id="29830"/>, this way you can use it at 100%, 66% and 33%. You lose the <Effect name="invulnerability"/> on signets from <Trait id="713"/> but gain more <Effect name="alacrity"/> and faster boonstrip with <Trait id="723"/> and <Trait id="729"/>.<br/>Time your distortions for the shockwave-shatter combo.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="druid">Use <Skill id="43636"/> from your Rock Gazelle for the first defiance bar and <Skill id="31639"/> from your Electric Wyvern pet for the second defiance bar. Use consumables if CC is not enough.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="berserker">Consider <Skill id="29941"/> for another CC skill. Use consumables if CC is not enough.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="weaver">Use <Skill id="5733"/> from your Lightning Hammer for CC.</Tip>
