<Message>
Despite being very common in pugs, this build is not meta! We highly recommend to play [Heal Renegade](/builds/revenant/heal-renegade) instead if your team struggle to survive, since Firebrand can deal way more damage than Renegade.

If you play this build we highly recommend learning the signet share variant. If you just want a good and smooth run, take a look at the [Fractal Pages](/fractals).

It provides permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/>, <Boon name="Regeneration"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/> and a decent amount of might. Exactly like the meta-counterpart it provides good offensive support via <Skill name="Bane Signet"/>, it is improtant to understand that the signet share is essential to faster runs and sharing extra power during Exposed (broken Defiance bar). The main source of <Boon name="Quickness"/> is <Skill name="Restoring Reprieve"/> and <Skill name="Potent Haste"/>; <Skill name="Feel My Wrath"/> is optional.

The heal firebrand heals with any symbols, dodges, <Boon name="Regeneration"/>, <Skill name="Restoring Reprieve"/>, and if necessary <Skill name="Bow of Truth"/>. If your group is unable to stay alive, you can swap out your offensive support (<Skill name="Bane Signet"/> and radience) to virtues for more heals but it should not be needed.

When <Instability name="Afflicted"/> is present or enemies are applying conditions, you can use <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> (Staff3) and blast it with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> (Staff2) for area condition cleanse.

<Divider text="Equipment"/>

Note that this build variant is optimized for 150 agony resistance.  
If you have more AR, feel free to swap out harrier pieces for cleric, as long as you are maintaining 100% boonduration. Please take in mind, that this is not _THE_ gear setup you have to play, there are many variants that work. Its all about maximizing boon duration and healing power.  
Yes, you can play full harrier - however you will loose some healing power.

<Card title="Skill Usage">
Prestacking:
- Press <Skill name="Empower"/>
- Press <Skill name="Restoring Reprieve"/> and <Skill name="Potent Haste"/> each twice; press <Skill name="Feel My Wrath"/>
- Take mistlock 
- Press <Skill name="Empower"/> again

To keep up <Boon name="Quickness"/>:

- Use <Skill name="Feel My Wrath"/> whenever ready
- Use <Skill name="Restoring Reprieve"/> and <Skill name="Potent Haste"/> but leave one charge left (unless the fight is close to being over)
- Only use these skills close to your allies - try to "puke" on them with the mantras

To keep up <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Fury"/>:

- Always prestack <Boon name="Might"/> on the mistlock!
- You can press <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> (Axe2) exactly 3 times before your <Skill name="Empower"/> (Staff4) if off cooldown again.
- You wanna maximize the uptime of <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> while pressing <Skill name="Empower"/> off cooldown.

CCing:

- Always use <Skill name="Bane Signet"/>! This is one of the most important things you have to do!
- Use <Skill name="Blazing Edge"/> (Axe3)
- Use <Skill name="Shield of Absorption"/> (Shield5)
- Using consumables such as <Item name="Metal Rod"/>, Sentinel Rifle and Termite Shovel is highly encouraged, since you having nothing to do anyway.

Tomes are very useful when no other skills are ready. <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> also gets refreshed every time an enemy dies (works with anomalies at Artsariiv/Arkk, knights at MAMA and hallucinations at Siax).

<Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> and <Skill name="Tome of Resolve"/> are great for high incoming damage scenarios.

- <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> (F1):
  - Skill 4 is a ticking AoE, good for single target and great for AoE DPS
  - Skill 5 makes your surrounding allies inflict <Condition name="Burning"/> - worth using as precast
  - Skill 3 is an AoE pull (150 defiance bar damage)
  - Often these skills are used as an opener
- <Skill name="Tome of Resolve"/> (F2):
  - Skill 2 is a party condition cleanse
  - Skill 3 grants <Boon name="Vigor"/>, <Boon name="Regeneration"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/>
  - Skill 4 is a good party heal
  - Skill 5 increases healing on allies for 8s by 33% and converts up to 5 conditions to boons
- <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> (F3):
  - Skill 1 grants <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/>
  - Skill 3 is a 5s reflect
  - Skill 4 grants <Boon name="resistance"/> and breaks stun
  - Skill 5 grants <Boon name="Aegis"/>, <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Stability"/> and 300 toughness for 5 seconds

This guide is good for people who want to start fractals with heal firebrand. We still highly recommend running the Radiance/Honor build variant from our Build section so you start playing with the proper build !
